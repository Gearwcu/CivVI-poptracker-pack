# CivVI AP Poptracker pack

After playing Civilization VI in archipelago in asyncs and the like I got a bit sick of having to remember which techs I had and hadn't done. And having to open the UT every time I wanted to know what would be in logic next.

Which is why I now present here a poptracker pack. Most of the logic I have build in and found a few logic bugs along the way (don't worry they were reported). If I do find a logic bug it will be shown in blue wi th a second location. 

Other than that All of the Era logic is included although seeing which specific tech you need is difficult to support but that may come later. For now all eras you have will be shown in yellow for Out of logic (ool) if you don't have the prerequisite techs to move to the next era. Becaause clearly if you can enter the era you'd most likely be able to do those techs/civics.

One more thing there are also buttons in the settings for:
1. Boostsanity
2. Progression Style
3. Excluded Locations

Excluded locations are missable boosts and goody huts that will have only filler items

Most importantly Auto Tracking works for it all!
